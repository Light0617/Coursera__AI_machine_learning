3.
Suppose we set ¿0=0,¿1=1.5 in the linear regression hypothesis from Q1. What is h¿(2)?

0+1.5*2=3

4. 
In the given figure, the cost function J(£c0,£c1) has been plotted against £c0 and £c1, 
as shown in 'Plot 2'. The contour plot for the same cost function is given in 'Plot 1'. 
Based on the figure, choose the correct options (check all that apply).

Point P (the global minimum of plot 2) corresponds to point A of Plot 1.

If we start from point B, gradient descent with a well-chosen learning 
rate will eventually help us reach at or near point A, as the value of
cost function J(£c0,£c1) is minimum at A.

5. (X)
Suppose that for some linear regression problem (say, 
predicting housing prices as in the lecture), we have some training set,
and for our training set we managed to find some £c0, £c1 such that J(£c0,£c1)=0.
Which of the statements below must then be true? (Check all that apply.)

We can perfectly predict the value of y even for new examples that we have not yet seen.(X)

For these values of £c0 and £c1 that satisfy J(£c0,£c1)=0,
we have that h£c(x(i))=y(i) for every training example (x(i),y(i)) (O)


For this to be true, we must have £c0=0 and £c1=0 so that h£c(x)=0 (X)

6.Which of the following statements are true?

If £c0 and £c1 are initialized at
the global minimum, then one iteration will not change their values.(O)

If the first few iterations of gradient descent cause f(£c0,£c1) to
increase rather than decrease, then the most likely cause is that we have set the
learning rate £\ to too large a value. (O)
